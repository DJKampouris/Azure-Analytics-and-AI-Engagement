# Azure OpenAI Service DREAM Demo

Azure OpenAI Service offers large-scale generative AI models with a deep understanding of language to enable new reasoning and comprehension capabilities for building cutting-edge applications. These models can be applied to a variety of use cases, such as writing assistance, code generation, and reasoning over data. You can also detect and mitigate harmful use of AI with built-in responsible AI and access enterprise-grade Azure security.

In this demo, you will see the Azure OpenAI Service based assistant for Enterprise Data in action. This will be followed by an AI - generated Social Media Campaign Recommendation demo using DALL-E 2, Florence and Azure OpenAI Service. And finally, you will see text summarization in a contact center scenario using Azure OpenAI with Speech Service.

----

## Products and Technologies showcased:

**1.	Azure OpenAI Service**

- Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation.
    
- The models used by Azure OpenAI use natural language instructions and examples provided during the generation call to identify the task being asked and skill required.
    
- With Azure OpenAI, customers get the security capabilities of Microsoft Azure while running the same models as OpenAI. Azure OpenAI offers private networking, regional availability, and responsible AI content filtering.

**2.	DALL-E 2**

- DALL·E 2 is an AI system that can create original, realistic images and art from a text description in natural language. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles. 
    
- DALL·E 2 can make realistic edits to existing images from a natural language caption. It can add and remove elements while taking shadows, reflections, and textures into account. It can also create different variations of it inspired by the original.

**3.	Project Florence (AI)**
    
- Project Florence is a Microsoft AI Cognitive Services initiative, to advance the state-of-the-art computer vision technologies and develop the next generation framework for visual recognition.

## Pre-requisites

* [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell command. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.
* [Clone the repository to your local](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Analytics-and-AI-Engagement/tree/azure-openai)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Scenario 2 - Social Media Campaign and Product Recommendation

In this use case, we are using Azure OpenAI’s powerful language models to automatically generate campaign title and description from user prompt. Computer Vision and Florence-based AI models remove the background from the original image and extract dense captions. After that, we are generating abstract background images by providing a prompt using DALL.E2 in Azure OpenAI Service. And finally, we are merging the image which does not include the original background with the generated background to create the final result.

**In the web app:**

1. From the left navigation bar **click** on "Social Media Campaign & Product Recomendation".

    ![image](media/scenario2_ui1.png)

2. **Click** on the "Dropdown" and **select** "Sports Car".

    ![image](media/scenario2_ui2.png)

3. **Scroll down** and **click** on "Process".

    ![image](media/scenario2_ui3.png)

4. The response 1 is an Instagram Campaign and response 2,3 are Recommended Image generated using ResponsibleAI.

    ![image](media/scenario2_ui4.png)

5. **Click** on "Show Prompt" at right top of the screen.

### Training the Knowledge Base using Postman and Python

To train the knowledge base for Scenario 1: "Azure OpenAI Service and Azure Cognitive Search powered chatbot for Enterprise data", we have used an automation script "openAISetup.ps1". However, the knowledge base can also be trained using the following steps:

### Steps to train the Knowledge Base:

1. **Start** VS Code on your loacal machine. The following screen will appear.
    ![VS Code landing page](media/vs_code_landing_page.png)

2. **Open** the locally cloned repository (mentioned in pre-requisites) in VS Code. You should be able to see all the necessary files as given in the screenshot below. Make sure that you extract all the zipped folder marked #3 in the screenshot. In the next steps, we will execute function app for all these folders one- by -one.
    
    ![Artifacts Folder Structure](media/folder_structure.png)

### Steps to generate POST URL for 'PDF Indexer' function app:

This function-app indexes an uploaded PDF file into the number of pages in the PDF.

1. Under the **func-pdf-indexer** folder, select function_app.py.
   
    ![PDF Indexer explorer](media/select_function_app.png)

2. **Open** a new terminal. In the next command line, **execute** the following code for the function to start.

    ```
    func start
    ```

    ![Start the function](media/func_start.png)

3. Once the execution is complete, the function will give the following URLs to perform DELETE and INDEXING operations. **Copy** the 'pdfindexer' URL for further use.

    ![URLs](media/urls_pdf_indexer.png)


4. **Open** the Postman application, then **select** the "New" button to create a new request.

    ![Select new request.](media/select_new_request.png)

5. In the pop up window, **select** HTTP request.

    ![Select HTTP request.](media/select_http.png)

6.  In the new request page, **select** "POST" method from the dropdown as shown in the screenshot.

   ![Select POST request.](media/select_post1.png)

7. **Paste** the 'pdfindexer' URL copied earlier from the VS Code terminal in the text fiels next to POST. (Copied in step #18). 
8. Select the Body tab to add other parameters.

    ![Paste POST URL.](media/post_url.png)

9. **Select** the "Body" option , **select**  “form-data”.
10. Provide the required key-value pair as given below.

| Key | Value |
|--------------|-------------|
| index_name | prod-responsibleai-search |
| container_name |knowledge-base-responsibleai |
| pdf | [Select the PDF 'Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements.pdf' shared with you in the package] |

11. Click on **Send**.

 ![Fill in form-data](media/form_body.png)

12.  **View** the response.

 ![Response for PDF Indexer](media/response_pdf.png)

13. Our Knowledge Base has been trained on "Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-v2-General-Requirements.pdf".

14. **Repeat** step number 10, by replacing the "PDF" with the rest of the ResponsibleAI PDFs available in the package, to train the knowledge base completely.
